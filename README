This is a collection of charge transport tutorials using the 
VOTCA-CTP package, http://www.votca.org

The development of VOTCA is mainly funded by academic research grants.
If you use this package, please cite the following paper:

Microscopic simulations of charge transport in disordered organic semiconductors, 
V. Ruehle, A. Lukyanov, F. May, M. Schrader, T. Vehoff, J. Kirkpatrick, B. Baumeier, D. Andrienko, 
J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2011, 7 (10), pp. 3335â€“3345

Please post questions in the google discussion group at
